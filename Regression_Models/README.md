# Regression Models Repository

## Overview

This repository contains various regression models used for predicting and understanding data. Regression models are a type of statistical model that estimate the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Linear Regression/`: This directory contains scripts and notebooks for linear regression models.
- `Polynomial Regression/`: This directory contains scripts and notebooks for polynomial regression models.
- `Support Vector Regression/`: This directory contains scripts and notebooks for Support Vector Regression (SVR) models, a powerful machine learning technique for regression problems with non-linear relationships.

## Usage

To use the scripts or notebooks in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the appropriate directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Regression_Models.git
cd Regression_Models
```
